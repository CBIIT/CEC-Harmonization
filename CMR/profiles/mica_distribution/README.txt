Mica
------------------------

Mica is a powerful software application used to create web portals for epidemiological study consortia.

Using Mica, consortia can build personalised web sites for publishing their research activities and their membership.
Mica includes many domain-specific features such as study catalogues, data dictionary browsers, on-line data access
request forms, community tools (forums, events, news) and others.

Mica Distribution is the quickest way to get you up and running with Drupal Mica (http://drupal.org/project/mica).
It includes the latest versions of Drupal core, Mica modules, and the other modules it depends on.
During installation, Mica Distribution provides basic configuration of the Mica modules.


REQUIREMENTS
------------------------

Mica depends on Apache Solr (http://lucene.apache.org/solr), the Search API module
provides already some documentation for setting up a Solr server.

See the "Setting up Solr" paragraph at its documentation:
  http://drupalcode.org/project/search_api_solr.git/blob_plain/refs/heads/7.x-1.x:/INSTALL.txt


INSTALLATION
------------------------

So, if you're a developer or are just trying to build a copy of Mica Distribution yourself directly, run the command:
drush make build-mica_distribution.make /path/to/webroot
